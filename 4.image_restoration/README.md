## Project 4：Image Restoration
> The scoring method for this project is as follows:
1. Implement a blurring filter using the equation (5.6-11，数字图像处理（第三版）) in textbook, and blur the test image ‘book_cover.jpg’ using parameters a=b=0.1 and T=1. (20%)
2. Add Gaussian noise of 0 mean and variance of 500 to the blurred image. (10%)
3. Restore the blurred image and the blurred noisy image using the inverse filter. (30%)
4. Restore the blurred noisy image using the parametric Wiener filter with at least 3 different parameters, and compare and analyse results with that of 3. (40%)
